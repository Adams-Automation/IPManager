        <h1>Ignore List</h1>
        <p>
            The ignore list consist of 2 UI parts. The first part can be found on the main window as an ignore button.<br />
            The second part can be found in the settings page as an ignore list and an restore button. <br />
            The goal of the ignore list is to ignore certain network interfaces so that they don't show up in your selection list.<br />
            <br />
            For example like the vmware interfaces do. <br />
            This way it makes it easier for the end user to quickly select the correct adapter.
        </p>

        <h4>Ignore a network interface</h4>
        <p>
            To ignore a network interface the button "Ignore" has to be pressed next to the selected network interface.<br />
            When this button is pressed, the network interface is actively ignored and won't show up in the selection list.
        </p>

        <h4>Restore a network interface</h4>
        <p>
            To restore a network interface, we first have to open the settings page.<br />
            Once this page is open we can see the ignored list at the bottom of the window.<br />
            <br />
            In the list we can select the network interface we have to restore, this means to be able to select this interface again.<br />
            After selecting the interface the button "Restore" has to be pressed.<br />
            When this is done the network interface will show up again in the selection list.
