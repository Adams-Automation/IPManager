        <h1>Ignore List</h1>
        <p>
            The ignore list consist of 2 UI parts. The first part can be found on the main window as an ignore button.
            The second part can be found in the settings page as an ignore list and an restore button. 
            The goal of the ignore list is to ignore certain network interfaces so that they don't show up in your selection list.
            <br />
            For example like the vmware interfaces do. 
            This way it makes it easier for the end user to quickly select the correct adapter.
