        <h1>Network Actions</h1>
        <p>There are 3 actions we can perform on an network adapter.</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Ignore the network adapter</li>
            <li>Set IP to the network adapter</li>
            <li>Set the network adapter to DHCP</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="Images/DHCP is set.png"/>

        <h4>Ignore the network adapter</h4>
        <p>
            This means that the network adapter won't show up in list any more and will be ignored.<br />
            Also in the future this adapter won't show up.
            If by mistake this network adapter is ignored, then you can always restore this adapter back into the list.<br />
            This can be done in the settings page.
        </p>

        <h4>Set IP to the network adapter</h4>
        <p>
            After selecting an IP address from the list the IP settings can be set to the network adapter.<br />
            By pressing the button a netsh command will be executed to set the IP settings to the correct adapter.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Set the network adapter to DHCP</h4>
        <p>
            When this selection is made the network adapter will be set to dhcp mode.<br />
            This means that the computer can receive it's IP settings from a dhcp-server.
