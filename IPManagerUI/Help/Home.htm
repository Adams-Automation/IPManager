        <h1>IP Manager</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The IP manager is a tool intended for people who need to change their IP address often. <br />
            It keeps track of stored IP's, which can be useful when you come back to certain networks from time to time.<br />
            This removes the headache to search for IP settings again and makes it easy to set them to the desired network adapter.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>When the tool is started the following window will be shown.</p>

        <br />
        <p>To start using this tool, we should start by adding some IP settings to our list. To do this we should press on the add button next to our list.</p>

        <br />

        <p>When you will click this button a pop up window will open where the IP settings can be filled in.<br/>
        Fill in the IP settings and click "Create".</p>

        <br />

        <p>Select the "Set IP" button. This will set the IP to you're network adapter.</p>

        <br />

        <p>The IP settings will now be set to the network adapter. When this is done it might look something like this.</p>
        <img src="Images/IP address is set.png"/>
        <br />

        <p>After finishing you're work, don't forget to put the network adapter back to DHCP. This can be done by selecting the "DHCP" button.</p>
        <img src="Images/Set DHCP highlighted.png"/>
        <br />

        <p>When DHCP is set it will look something like this. Notice that the "Mode" of the network adapter is "Dhcp".</p>
        <img src="Images/DHCP is set.png" />
        <br />

        <p>That's it, you succesfully added an IP setting and assigned this to you're network adapter.</p>
