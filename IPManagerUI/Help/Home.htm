        <h1>IP Manager</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The IP manager is a tool intended for people who need to change their IP address often. <br />
            It keeps track of stored IP's, which can be useful when you come back to certain networks from time to time.<br />
            This removes the headache to search for IP settings again and makes it easy to set them to the desired network adapter.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>1. To start using this tool, we should start by adding some IP settings to our list. To do this we should press on the add button next to our list.</p>
        <img src="./Images/DatabaseAdd.png" alt="Add IP setting to database." width="600"/>
        <br/>
        <p>2. When you will click this button a pop up window will open where the IP settings can be filled in.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>3. Select the newly added IP.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>4. Select the "Set IP" button. This will set the IP to you're network adapter.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>5. After finishing you're work, don't forget to put the network adapter back to DHCP. This can be done by selecting the "DHCP" button.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>That's it, you succesfully added an IP setting and assigned this to you're network adapter.</p>
