        <h1>Changing the database for the application.</h1>
        <p>There are three actions that can be done to change the database for the application :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new database at a given location with a given name.</li>
            <li>Search for a database on your local file system.</li>
            <li>Set the database location back to default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One of the main reasons to change the database is when you work togheter with a team, to share the database with the team.
        This way everyone can use the database and if a new IP setting is filled in everyone can use this setting once they make for instance an intervertion.</p>

        <h4>Create a new database</h4>
        <p>
            To create a new database press the button "New" behind the database location. Once this button is pressed the folder system will open. <br />
            In here you can specify the folder to save the database file in and also give the database a name.
        </p>

        <h4>Search for a local database</h4>
        <p>
            To search for an existing database you can press the three dots behind the database location "...". Once this button is pressed the folder system will open. <br />
            In here you can select the database file.
        </p>

        <img src="Images/Open new database.png" width="600" />

        <h4>Set the database location to default</h4>
        <p>
            To set the default database again you can press the default button behind the database location "Default". 
            This will automatically set the location back to the default file stored by the application.
            This is the location where the application is stored.
        </p>
